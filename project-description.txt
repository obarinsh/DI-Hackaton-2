Who wants to be a Millioner: Geography Edition

Think you know the world? Lets check this out!

An interactive web-based quiz where users answer multiple-choice questions about 
countries. Each question gives clues like population, flag, national food, capital city,
and more.


How It Works: 

	•	A question is generated based on random country data (e.g., flag, capital, population, national dish).
	•	One correct answer and three incorrect options are displayed.
	•	The answers are shuffled randomly.
	•	The user selects an answer and clicks Submit to check if it matches the correct one.
	•	The quiz contains 20 questions per round.
	•	There are two types of hints available:
	   •	50/50 Hint – eliminates two wrong answers, leaving only one correct and one remaining wrong answer.
	   •	Continent Hint – reveals the continent (e.g., Europe, Asia, South America) where the correct country is located.
	•	After answering all 20 questions:
	 •	The user receives their final score.
	 •	A short review message is displayed based on their performance.
	 •	A summary of all questions and answers is shown. For each incorrect answer, the correct one is highlighted to help the user learn.
